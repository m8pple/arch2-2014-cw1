/*! Controls printing of diagnostic and debug messages.

	You are encouraged to include diagnostic and debugging
	information in your CPU, but you should include a way
	to control how much is printed. The default should be
	to print nothing, but it is a good idea to have a way
	of turning it on and off _without_ recompiling. This function
	provides a way for the user to indicate both how much
	output they are interested in, and where that output
	should go (should it go to stdout, or stderr, or a file?).
	
	\param state Valid (non-empty) CPU handle.
	
	\param level What level of output should be printed. There
	is no specific format for the output format, the only
	requirement is that for level zero there is no output.
	
	\param dest Where the output should go. This should be
	remembered by the CPU simulator, then later passed
	to fprintf to provide output.
	
	\pre It is required that if level>0 then dest!=0, so the
	caller will always provide a valid destination if they
	have indicated they will require output.
	
	It is suggested that for level=1 you print out one
	line of information per instruction with basic information
	like the program counter and the instruction type, and for higher
	levels you may want to print the CPU state before each
	instruction. Both of these can usually be inserted in
	just one place in the processor, and can greatly aid
	debugging.

	However, this is completely implementation defined behaviour,
	so your simulator does not have to print anything for
	any debug level if you don't want to.

	in case elsewhere you are not sure if resources have been released yet:
	
		mips_cpu_h cpu=mips_cpu_create(...);
		...
		mips_cpu_free(h);	// This is fine
