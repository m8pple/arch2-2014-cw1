/*! \file mips_mem.h
    Defines the functions used to interact with simulated memory.
    
    Note that the notions of "memory/address space" and "RAM" are actually
    two related but distinct things (we will explore this more later).
    A memory space is some kind of addressable space that the CPU can
    read and write to, where addressable locations are identified by
    integers. For the moment we will only deal with one address space,
    but later on we'll see others. In this API, abstract memory spaces
    are accessed using the functions in \ref mips_mem_core, but they
    must be intially created using a device specific API from \ref mips_mem_devices.
    
    RAM is a particular kind of memory device, which maps reads and
    writes transactions at particular addresses to corresponding
    storage locations. ROM is another kind of memory device that you
    saw earlier. It is extremely common for multiple types of memory
    device to exist in one address space, but for now we will stick
    with the simple idea of having one RAM, which is created using mips_mem_create_ram.

/*! An opaque handle to a memory space.

    We can pass this around without knowing who or what provides the
    memory. This is an example of an "opaque data type" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_data_type
    and is commonly used in embedded systems and operating
    systems. An example you might have come across includes the
    FILE data-type used by fopen and fprintf in the C standard
    library.

    Because this is a pointer, we can safely give it the
    known value of 0 or NULL in order to get a known empty
    state. For example:
        
        mips_mem_h myMem=0; // Declare an empty handle
        
        if(some_condition)
            myMem=get_a_handle();
        
        if(myMem)
            do_something_with mem(myMem);
    
    So even without knowing what the data-structure is, we can still
    tell whether or not a handle is currently pointing at a
    data-structure.
